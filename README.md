## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains the project developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Internship conducted by AICTE Edunet Foundation**.  
The project focuses on **fault detection and classification in power distribution systems** using **Machine Learning**.  

Electric power systems are prone to faults such as **line-to-ground, line-to-line, double line-to-ground, and three-phase faults**. Rapid detection and classification of these faults are critical to ensure **grid stability, reliability, and uninterrupted power supply**.  

The solution leverages **electrical measurement data (voltage and current phasors)** to train ML models capable of distinguishing between **normal operating conditions** and **various fault scenarios**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
**Challenge**:  
- Design a Machine Learning model to **detect and classify different types of faults** in a power distribution system.  
- Input: Electrical measurement data (voltage & current phasors).  
- Output: Accurate classification of operating conditions as:  
  - Normal Operation  
  - Line-to-Ground Fault  
  - Line-to-Line Fault  
  - Double Line-to-Ground Fault  
  - Three-Phase Fault  

**Objective**:  
Enable **rapid and accurate fault identification** to improve grid **stability, safety, and reliability**.
