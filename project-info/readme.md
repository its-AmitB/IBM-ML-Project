## 🛠️ Steps to Implement the Project

### Step 1: Set up IBM Cloud and Watsonx AI
1. Create and verify your **IBM Cloud** account.  
2. Navigate to the **IBM Cloud Catalog**, find **Watsonx AI**, and create a new instance.  
3. Launch the service to access the Watsonx AI interface.

### Step 2: Prepare and Import Your Data
1. Obtain the **Power System Faults Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-systemfaults-dataset).  
2. Within your Watsonx AI project, **import this dataset**.  
   > This dataset will be the foundation for training your machine learning model.

### Step 3: Develop the Machine Learning Model
Inside Watsonx AI, develop a **supervised machine learning model** with the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean and prepare the imported dataset.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extract relevant features from electrical data, e.g., **RMS values** and **phase angles**.  

3. **Algorithm Selection**  
   - Choose a suitable classifier.  
   - For this project, a **Random Forest Classifier** (Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier) is recommended.  

4. **Training**  
   - Train the model using the prepared dataset.

### Step 4: Deploy and Test the Model
1. Deploy the trained model on **IBM Cloud**.  
2. Test the model to ensure it can **accurately classify new fault data**.  
3. Objective: Enable **rapid and accurate fault identification**.  
4. Reported Result: Achieved **~90% accuracy** in fault classification.
