Step 1: Set up IBM Cloud and Watsonx AI
First, create and verify your IBM Cloud account. Then, navigate to the IBM Cloud Catalog, find "Watsonx AI," and create a new instance. Launch the service to access its interface.

Step 2: Prepare and Import Your Data
Obtain the power system faults dataset from Kaggle. Next, within your Watsonx AI project, import this dataset. This will be the foundation for training your machine learning model.

Step 3: Develop the Machine Learning Model
Inside Watsonx AI, you'll need to develop a supervised machine learning model. This involves a series of key actions:



Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the imported data.


Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the electrical data, such as RMS values and phase angles.


Algorithm Selection: Choose a suitable classifier for your model, such as a Random Forest Classifier. The model will be a 

Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier.


Training: Train the model using the prepared dataset.

Step 4: Deploy and Test the Model
After training, deploy your model on IBM Cloud. You can then test it to ensure it can accurately classify new data. The objective is to enable rapid and accurate fault identification. The project's reported result was a 90% accuracy rate.
